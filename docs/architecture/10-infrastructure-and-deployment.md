# **10\. Infrastructure and Deployment**

## **Infrastructure as Code**

* **Tool:** N/A. No cloud infrastructure is being provisioned.  
* **Location:** N/A.  
* **Approach:** The "infrastructure" is the user's local machine with Node.js and npm installed. The project's package.json files define all necessary dependencies.

## **Deployment Strategy**

* **Strategy:** Local execution. "Deployment" consists of running scripts from the project's root directory.  
* **CI/CD Platform:** N/A. No continuous integration or deployment pipeline is needed for the MVP.  
* **Pipeline Configuration:** N/A.

## **Environments**

* **Development:** The only environment is the local development environment, run via npm run dev.

## **Rollback Strategy**

* **Primary Method:** Version control via Git. Changes can be reverted by checking out a previous commit.  
* **Trigger Conditions:** N/A.  
* **Recovery Time Objective:** N/A.
