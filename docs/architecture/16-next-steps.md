# **16\. Next Steps**

This architecture document, in conjunction with the PRD, provides all the necessary information to begin development. The next logical step is to hand this off to the development team (or in this case, the dev agent).

## **Developer Handoff Prompt**

**To: Dev Agent**

The fullstack architecture for the AR.Drone 2.0 Web Controller is complete and documented. Please begin implementation by following the epics and stories outlined in the prd.md.

Start with **Epic 1, Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding**. Your first task is to create the monorepo structure as defined in the **Source Tree** section of the architecture document.
