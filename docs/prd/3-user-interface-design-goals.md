# **3\. User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience will be immersive and focused, prioritizing the live video feed above all else. The interface should feel like a cockpit window, not a complex dashboard. All controls and status information will be presented as non-intrusive overlays, ensuring the user's attention remains on flying the drone. The design will be clean, modern, and minimalist to support the goal of rapid development and intuitive operation.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

The primary interaction paradigm is a full-screen video display with context-sensitive overlays.

* **Status Information:** Displayed passively at the top of the screen.  
* **Flight Controls:** Presented actively at the bottom of the screen, with clear, touch/click-friendly targets for virtual joysticks and action buttons.

## **Core Screens and Views**

* **Main Control Interface:** A single, all-encompassing view that includes the video feed, status bar, and control bar. There are no other primary screens or views in the MVP.

## **Accessibility: None**

* For the initial MVP, accessibility features are not a primary focus. The design will prioritize functional simplicity for rapid development.

## **Branding**

* There are no specific branding requirements for this personal project. The design will use a clean, modern, and generic aesthetic.

## **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

* The application will be a responsive web app, designed to function on any desktop browser.
