# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a basic monorepo structure with a Node.js backend and a frontend web app,  
**so that** I have a clean, organized foundation to start building the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A single Git repository is initialized.
2. The repository contains a packages directory with two subdirectories: api (for the backend) and web (for the frontend).
3. The api package has a basic Node.js server setup (e.g., using Express or Fastify).
4. The web package is initialized with a modern frontend framework (e.g., using Vite + React).
5. A root package.json is configured to manage both workspaces.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create monorepo structure with packages directory (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create packages/api directory
  - [x] Create packages/web directory

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo using standard npm workspaces
- **Platform**: Local machine deployment
- **No external services required for MVP**

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-components.md]
- **Backend Server (api package)**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
  - Dependencies: express, ws (WebSocket library), node-ar-drone
  - Exposes WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication
- **Frontend Web App (web package)**: React, Vite, TypeScript
  - Dependencies: react, tailwindcss
  - Connects to backend WebSocket endpoint

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **Shared Types Location**: packages/shared/types.ts
- **DroneTelemetry Interface**: batteryPercentage, flightState, wifiSignalStrength
- **ControlCommand Union Type**: TAKE_OFF, LAND, EMERGENCY_STOP, SWITCH_CAMERA, MOVE

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md]
- **Versions**: Must use TypeScript 5.4.5 and Node.js 20.11.0
- **Linting**: Default Vite config for frontend, standard TypeScript for backend
- **Formatting**: Prettier on save
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., FlightControls.tsx)
  - Hooks: camelCase with prefix (e.g., useDroneSocket.ts)
  - API Files: kebab-case (e.g., drone-client.ts)
  - Types/Interfaces: PascalCase
- **Critical Rules**:
  - Frontend MUST NOT contain direct node-ar-drone references
  - All WebSocket messages must conform to defined types
  - No environment variables for MVP - hardcode configuration

### Testing
[Source: architecture/13-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Approach**: Test-After for MVP
- **Backend Testing**: Jest framework
- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest framework
- **File Convention**: [filename].test.ts or [filename].test.tsx
- **Location**: Co-located with source files
- **Mocking**: All external dependencies must be mocked
- **Test Data**: Hardcoded within test files

## QA Results

### Review Date: July 30, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - The project scaffolding has been implemented with high quality and attention to detail. The monorepo structure is clean, properly configured, and follows industry best practices. Both backend and frontend packages are well-architected with appropriate separation of concerns.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: packages/web/.eslintrc.cjs
  - **Change**: Fixed ESLint configuration by changing '@typescript-eslint/recommended' to 'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended'
  - **Why**: The original configuration was invalid and causing linting to fail, preventing proper code quality checks
  - **How**: This ensures proper TypeScript linting rules are applied, improving code quality and catching potential issues early

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ **PASS** - All code follows TypeScript 5.4.5 and Node.js 20.11.0 requirements. Naming conventions properly applied (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions). Test files co-located with source files using .test.ts/.test.tsx extension.
- **Project Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Monorepo structure perfectly matches architectural specifications. packages/api and packages/web directories properly organized with correct file placement.
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ **PASS** - Test-after approach implemented with Jest for backend and Vitest for frontend. All tests pass successfully with appropriate coverage for initial scaffolding.
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ **PASS** - All five acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified.

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed ESLint configuration for proper TypeScript linting (packages/web/.eslintrc.cjs)
- [x] Verified all build processes work correctly (TypeScript compilation, Vite bundling)
- [x] Confirmed test suite execution passes for both packages
- [x] Validated workspace configuration and cross-package script execution

### Security Review

**Status: SECURE** - No security concerns identified. The implementation follows security best practices:
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information
- Proper error handling in Express server
- No direct exposure of internal APIs
- Test environment properly isolated

### Performance Considerations

**Status: OPTIMIZED** - Performance considerations appropriately addressed for scaffolding phase:
- Vite configuration optimized for development and production builds
- TypeScript strict mode enabled for better runtime performance
- Proper tree-shaking enabled through ES modules
- Concurrent development script setup for efficient local development

### Technical Excellence Notes

**Backend Architecture:**
- Clean Express server setup with proper HTTP server creation
- WebSocket integration properly configured with ws library
- TypeScript configuration follows strict guidelines with comprehensive compiler options
- Jest testing environment properly isolated from production

**Frontend Architecture:**
- Modern Vite + React setup with optimal configuration
- Tailwind CSS properly integrated for styling system
- Vitest configured for optimal testing experience
- TypeScript configurations (both app and node) properly separated

**Workspace Management:**
- npm workspaces properly configured with appropriate script delegation
- Concurrent execution setup for development workflow
- Version dependencies correctly specified and locked to required versions
- Build processes properly orchestrated across packages

### Final Status

**✅ APPROVED - Ready for Done**

This implementation demonstrates excellent engineering practices and provides a solid foundation for the AR Drone Controller application. The scaffolding is complete, well-tested, and ready for feature development to begin.
