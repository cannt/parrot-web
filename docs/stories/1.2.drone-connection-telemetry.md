# Story 1.2: Drone Connection and Telemetry

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** the backend server to connect to the AR.Drone 2.0 and stream its telemetry data to the frontend,  
**so that** the web app can display real-time status information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The backend server successfully initializes the node-ar-drone client and establishes a connection with the drone.
2. The server captures telemetry data (at a minimum: battery level, flight state, Wi-Fi signal).
3. A WebSocket connection is established between the frontend and the backend server.
4. The backend broadcasts received telemetry data to all connected frontend clients via the WebSocket.
5. The frontend client can receive and log the telemetry data to the browser console.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.project-scaffolding.md - Dev Agent Record]
- **Project Structure**: Monorepo successfully implemented with packages/api and packages/web
- **Backend Foundation**: Express server with WebSocket support already configured
- **Frontend Foundation**: Vite + React + TypeScript setup complete
- **Testing Environment**: Jest (backend) and Vitest (frontend) configured and working
- **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation and workspace scripts validated

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: Express 4.19.2 - already configured
- **Real-time API**: WebSocket (ws) 8.17.0 - already installed in packages/api
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.4.5 - strict mode enabled
- **Backend Testing**: Jest 29.7.0 - configured with proper mocking setup

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
```typescript
// packages/shared/types.ts
export interface DroneTelemetry {
  batteryPercentage: number;
  flightState: 'landed' | 'flying' | 'hovering' | 'error' | 'unknown';
  wifiSignalStrength: number;
}
```

### Core Workflow Pattern
[Source: architecture/7-core-workflows.md]
- **Communication Flow**: Frontend ↔ Backend (WebSocket) ↔ Drone (UDP/TCP)
- **Backend Role**: Proxy/Facade pattern - translates WebSocket messages to drone commands
- **Real-time Data**: Backend receives drone telemetry and broadcasts to all connected clients
- **Observer Pattern**: Frontend observes backend for telemetry updates via WebSocket

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-components.md]
- **Backend Server Dependencies**: node-ar-drone, ws (WebSocket library), express
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: Single endpoint /ws for all real-time communication
- **Frontend Integration**: React hooks pattern for WebSocket management

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Platform**: Local machine - no external services required
- **Backend Proxy/Facade**: Node.js server encapsulates complex UDP/TCP drone interactions
- **Component-Based UI**: Frontend uses reusable components and custom hooks
- **Observer Pattern**: Frontend reactively updates UI as telemetry data arrives

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: architecture/9-source-tree.md]
- **Shared Types**: packages/shared/types.ts (new directory to create)
- **Backend Drone Client**: packages/api/src/drone-client.ts (new file)
- **Frontend Hook**: packages/web/src/hooks/useDroneSocket.ts (new file)
- **Backend Entry**: packages/api/src/index.ts (modify to add WebSocket + drone integration)
- **Frontend App**: packages/web/src/App.tsx (modify to integrate WebSocket hook)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md]
- **API Files**: kebab-case naming (drone-client.ts)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with prefix (useDroneSocket.ts)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (DroneTelemetry)
- **Critical Rule**: Frontend MUST NOT contain direct node-ar-drone references - all drone communication via backend proxy
- **Type Safety**: All WebSocket messages MUST conform to DroneTelemetry interface
- **No Environment Variables**: Hardcode configuration for MVP

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/13-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Approach**: Test-After for MVP
- **Backend Testing**: Jest with mocked node-ar-drone client
- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest with mocked WebSocket connections
- **File Convention**: [filename].test.ts co-located with source files
- **Mocking Requirements**: Mock all external dependencies (node-ar-drone, WebSocket connections)
- **Test Data**: Hardcoded telemetry data within test files

### External Dependencies
[Source: architecture/6-external-apis.md]
- **No External APIs**: Application is self-contained, communicates directly with drone via local backend proxy

### Technical Implementation Notes
- **node-ar-drone Library**: Core dependency for drone communication - must be added to packages/api
- **WebSocket Integration**: Extend existing Express server from Story 1.1 to include WebSocket support
- **Error Handling**: Robust connection handling for drone connection failures and WebSocket disconnections
- **Real-time Performance**: Minimize latency in telemetry data flow from drone to frontend
- **Connection Management**: Handle multiple frontend clients connecting to single drone session
