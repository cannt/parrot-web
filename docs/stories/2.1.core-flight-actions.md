# Story 2.1: Core Flight Actions

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** to be able to command the drone to Takeoff, Land, and perform an Emergency Stop,  
**so that** I can manage the basic flight state of the drone safely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The UI displays distinct buttons for "Takeoff/Land" and "Emergency Stop".
2. Clicking the "Takeoff" button sends the takeoff command to the drone. The drone's state (from telemetry) updates to "Flying".
3. When the drone is flying, the button changes to "Land". Clicking it sends the land command. The drone's state updates to "Landed".
4. Clicking the "Emergency Stop" button at any time sends the emergency command, immediately cutting power to the motors.

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.3.live-video-stream-display.md - Dev Agent Records]
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Comprehensive WebSocket server with client connection management and message broadcasting proven working
- **DroneClient Integration**: DroneClient class established with ar-drone library, ready for extension with flight commands
- **React Hook Pattern**: useDroneSocket.ts pattern proven for WebSocket integration - extend for command sending
- **Component Architecture**: Component-based React architecture established, follow VideoPlayer pattern for new FlightControls component
- **Testing Strategy**: Jest (backend) and Vitest (frontend) with comprehensive mocking proven working
- **Type System**: Shared types system established and working between packages

### Data Models and Types
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **ControlCommand Interface**: Already defined with TAKE_OFF, LAND, EMERGENCY_STOP command types
- **DroneTelemetry Interface**: flightState property already defined with 'landed' | 'flying' | 'hovering' | 'error' | 'unknown'
- **Shared Types Location**: packages/shared/types.ts - already contains required command and telemetry types
- **Type Safety**: All WebSocket messages must conform to ControlCommand and DroneTelemetry interfaces

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-components.md]
- **Backend Server (api package)**: Acts as proxy translating WebSocket messages to ar-drone UDP/TCP commands
- **Frontend Web App (web package)**: Captures user input and sends ControlCommand data models via WebSocket
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: Single /ws endpoint for all real-time bidirectional communication

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/7-core-workflows.md]
- **Command Flow Pattern**: User → Frontend → WebSocket → Backend → Drone (UDP) → Telemetry Response → WebSocket → Frontend → UI Update
- **Real-time Response**: Flight state changes broadcast immediately via WebSocket telemetry updates
- **UI Reactivity**: Frontend observes backend for telemetry data, updates UI reactively

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Backend Proxy/Facade**: Node.js server encapsulates complex ar-drone interactions behind simple WebSocket API
- **Component-Based UI**: FlightControls will be reusable component following established patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Frontend observes flight state changes via WebSocket telemetry broadcasting

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: architecture/9-source-tree.md & previous implementations]
- **Backend Extension**: packages/api/src/drone-client.ts (extend existing DroneClient class)
- **Frontend Component**: packages/web/src/components/FlightControls.tsx (new component)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md]
- **Components**: PascalCase (FlightControls.tsx)
- **API Files**: kebab-case (drone-client.ts)
- **Type Safety**: All flight commands MUST conform to ControlCommand interface
- **Critical Rule**: Frontend MUST NOT contain direct ar-drone references - all commands via backend proxy
- **Naming**: Hooks use camelCase with use prefix, Types use PascalCase

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/13-test-strategy-and-standards.md]

## QA Results

### Review Date: July 31, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with comprehensive flight command integration and proper separation of concerns between backend drone control and frontend UI state management. The architecture successfully follows the established proxy/facade pattern where the backend encapsulates ar-drone complexity behind a clean WebSocket API.

**Key Strengths:**
- Comprehensive flight command implementation (takeoff, land, emergency stop) with proper error handling
- State-aware UI design that intelligently switches between takeoff/land based on telemetry
- Robust WebSocket command processing with acknowledgment system
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout with shared interfaces
- Good visual design with clear status indicators and accessible button styling
- follows established patterns from previous stories for consistency

**Areas Requiring Attention:**
- Test reliability issues affecting CI/CD pipeline stability
- Type definition inconsistencies between frontend and backend (resolved during review)
- Some async timing patterns in tests need refinement

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: packages/api/src/types/types.ts
  - **Change**: Added missing ControlCommand interface and command message type to WebSocketMessage union
  - **Why**: Backend types were missing the ControlCommand interface causing compilation errors and test failures
  - **How**: Synchronized type definitions between frontend and backend to ensure consistency and proper TypeScript compilation

- **File**: packages/web/src/hooks/useDroneSocket.test.ts
  - **Change**: Enhanced mock WebSocket to properly log sent data for debugging test issues
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to undefined sent data, needed better debugging visibility
  - **How**: Added console logging to mock WebSocket send method to track data flow

- **File**: packages/web/src/App.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Added missing sendCommand function to WebSocket hook mock and corrected CSS selector for styling test
  - **Why**: Mock was incomplete causing component render failures, and test was checking wrong element for styling
  - **How**: Complete mock implementation and proper DOM element selection for header styling verification

- **File**: packages/web/src/components/VideoPlayer.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed muted attribute test to use property check instead of attribute check
  - **Why**: JSDOM handles boolean attributes differently than real browsers
  - **How**: Changed from `toHaveAttribute('muted')` to `videoElement.muted).toBe(true)` for reliable testing

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **PASSED** - All naming conventions properly followed (PascalCase for FlightControls component, kebab-case for drone-client.ts, camelCase for useDroneSocket hook). TypeScript interfaces properly defined with PascalCase. No direct ar-drone references in frontend maintained.
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **PASSED** - Files correctly placed according to monorepo architecture (components in packages/web/src/components/, API files in packages/api/src/, shared types properly distributed). Flight controls integrated into established sidebar layout.
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Comprehensive test coverage exists with proper mocking strategies, but test reliability issues prevent full CI/CD success. Test-after approach followed correctly with co-located .test.ts/.test.tsx files.
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **PASSED** - All four acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional.
