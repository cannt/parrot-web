# Story 2.2: Implement Movement and Rotation Controls

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** on-screen controls to move the drone forward/backward, left/right, up/down, and to rotate it,  
**so that** I can pilot the drone effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The UI displays two virtual joysticks or similar on-screen controls.
2. The left control manages forward/backward and left/right strafing movements.
3. The right control manages altitude (up/down) and rotation (clockwise/counter-clockwise).
4. Interacting with the controls sends the corresponding movement commands to the backend server, which are then relayed to the drone.
5. The drone responds to the control inputs in real-time.
6. Releasing the controls causes the drone to stop and hover.

[Source: docs/stories/2.1.core-flight-actions.md - Dev Agent Records]
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Comprehensive WebSocket server with client connection management and message broadcasting proven working with ControlCommand handling
- **DroneClient Integration**: DroneClient class established with ar-drone library, ready for extension with movement commands
- **React Hook Pattern**: useDroneSocket.ts pattern proven for WebSocket integration - extend for continuous command sending
- **Component Architecture**: Component-based React architecture established, follow FlightControls pattern for new MovementControls component
- **Testing Strategy**: Jest (backend) and Vitest (frontend) with comprehensive mocking proven working
- **Type System**: Shared types system with ControlCommand interface established and working between packages

### Data Models and Types
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **ControlCommand Interface**: Already defined with MOVE command type including payload structure
- **Movement Payload Structure**: 
  - pitch: number (Forward/Backward tilt, -1 to 1)
  - roll: number (Left/Right tilt, -1 to 1) 
  - yaw: number (Rotational speed, -1 to 1)
  - gaz: number (Vertical speed/altitude, -1 to 1)
- **Shared Types Location**: packages/shared/types.ts - contains required ControlCommand MOVE interface
- **Type Safety**: All WebSocket messages must conform to ControlCommand interface with proper payload validation

### Component Specifications  
[Source: architecture/5-components.md]
- **Backend Server (api package)**: Acts as proxy translating WebSocket MOVE messages to ar-drone UDP/TCP movement commands
- **Frontend Web App (web package)**: Captures joystick input and sends ControlCommand MOVE data models via WebSocket
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: Single /ws endpoint for all real-time bidirectional communication including movement commands

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/7-core-workflows.md]
- **Movement Command Flow Pattern**: User → Joystick → Frontend → WebSocket → Backend → Drone (UDP) → Telemetry Response → WebSocket → Frontend → UI Update
- **Real-time Response**: Movement commands sent continuously while joystick is active, stop commands on release
- **UI Reactivity**: Frontend captures joystick input and translates to normalized movement values in real-time

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: architecture/9-source-tree.md & previous implementations]
- **Backend Extension**: packages/api/src/drone-client.ts (extend existing DroneClient class with movement methods)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md]
- **Components**: PascalCase (VirtualJoystick.tsx, MovementControls.tsx)
- **API Files**: kebab-case (drone-client.ts)
- **Type Safety**: All movement commands MUST conform to ControlCommand MOVE interface with proper payload structure
- **Critical Rule**: Frontend MUST NOT contain direct ar-drone references - all movement commands via backend proxy
- **Naming**: Hooks use camelCase with use prefix, Types use PascalCase

- [ ] Consider extracting joystick calculation logic to utility functions for enhanced testability
- [ ] Add E2E tests for real drone interaction (beyond MVP scope)
- [ ] Implement visual joystick position persistence across component re-renders

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified.** The implementation properly follows the established security patterns:
- Frontend has no direct ar-drone library references (enforced by architecture)
- All drone communication properly proxied through backend WebSocket server
- Movement commands use normalized values with appropriate bounds checking
- No exposure of sensitive data in movement payloads
- Proper input validation for joystick position calculations

### Performance Considerations

**Excellent performance optimization.** Key performance features implemented:
- **Throttled Command Sending**: 20 FPS (50ms) throttling prevents WebSocket flooding
