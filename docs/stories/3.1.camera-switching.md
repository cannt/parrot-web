# Story 3.1: Camera Switching

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** a button to switch between the drone's front and bottom cameras,  
**so that** I can change my perspective during flight.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A camera-switch icon or button is displayed on the UI.
2. Clicking the button sends the appropriate "switch camera" command to the drone.
3. The video stream displayed in the UI updates to show the feed from the newly selected camera.
4. The control works seamlessly while the drone is on the ground or in flight.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/2.2.movement-rotation-controls.md - Dev Agent Records]
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Comprehensive WebSocket server with client connection management and message broadcasting proven working with ControlCommand handling including SWITCH_CAMERA type already defined
- **DroneClient Integration**: DroneClient class established with ar-drone library, ready for extension with camera commands
- **React Hook Pattern**: useDroneSocket.ts pattern proven for WebSocket integration - extend for camera command sending
- **Component Architecture**: Component-based React architecture established, follow FlightControls and MovementControls pattern for new CameraSwitchControl component
- **Testing Strategy**: Jest (backend) and Vitest (frontend) with comprehensive mocking proven working
- **Type System**: Shared types system with ControlCommand interface established and working between packages including SWITCH_CAMERA command type

### Data Models and Types
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **ControlCommand Interface**: Already defined with SWITCH_CAMERA command type - no payload needed for simple camera switch
- **ControlCommand Type Definition**: 
  ```typescript
  export type ControlCommand = 
    | { type: 'TAKE_OFF' }
    | { type: 'LAND' }
    | { type: 'EMERGENCY_STOP' }
    | { type: 'SWITCH_CAMERA' }  // Already defined - ready for implementation
    | { type: 'MOVE'; payload: { pitch: number; roll: number; yaw: number; gaz: number; } };
  ```
- **Shared Types Location**: packages/shared/types.ts - contains required ControlCommand SWITCH_CAMERA interface
- **Type Safety**: All WebSocket messages must conform to ControlCommand interface with proper validation

### Component Specifications  
[Source: architecture/5-components.md]
- **Backend Server (api package)**: Acts as proxy translating WebSocket SWITCH_CAMERA messages to ar-drone UDP/TCP camera commands
- **Frontend Web App (web package)**: Captures camera switch button clicks and sends ControlCommand SWITCH_CAMERA data models via WebSocket
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: Single /ws endpoint for all real-time bidirectional communication including camera commands

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/7-core-workflows.md]
- **Camera Switch Command Flow Pattern**: User → Button Click → Frontend → WebSocket → Backend → Drone (UDP) → Camera Switch → Video Stream Update
- **Command Response**: Camera switch commands sent on user click, video stream should update to show new camera perspective
- **UI Reactivity**: Frontend captures button clicks and sends SWITCH_CAMERA commands via established WebSocket infrastructure

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: architecture/9-source-tree.md & previous implementations]
- **Backend Extension**: packages/api/src/drone-client.ts (extend existing DroneClient class with switchCamera method)
- **Frontend Components**: 
  - packages/web/src/components/CameraSwitchControl.tsx (new camera switch button component)
- **WebSocket Integration**: packages/api/src/index.ts (extend existing WebSocket SWITCH_CAMERA command handling)
- **Frontend Hook**: packages/web/src/hooks/useDroneSocket.ts (extend for camera command sending)
- **App Integration**: packages/web/src/App.tsx (integrate CameraSwitchControl component)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/12-coding-standards.md]
- **Components**: PascalCase (CameraSwitchControl.tsx)
- **API Files**: kebab-case (drone-client.ts)
- **Type Safety**: All camera switch commands MUST conform to ControlCommand SWITCH_CAMERA interface
- **Critical Rule**: Frontend MUST NOT contain direct ar-drone references - all camera commands via backend proxy
- **Naming**: Hooks use camelCase with use prefix, Types use PascalCase

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/13-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Backend Testing**: Jest with mocked ar-drone client for camera switching command methods
- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest with mocked WebSocket connections and click events for camera switch interactions
- **File Convention**: [filename].test.ts/.tsx co-located with source files
- **Mocking Requirements**: Mock ar-drone library camera commands, WebSocket connections, button click events
- **Test Focus**: Camera switch command sending, button click handling, visual feedback for current camera state

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Real-time API**: WebSocket (ws) 8.17.0 - already implemented for command processing
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18.3.1 with component-based architecture for camera switch component
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.3 - for camera switch button styling and visual feedback
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.4.5 - strict mode for type safety in camera command handling
- **Backend Runtime**: Node.js 20.11.0 with Express 4.19.2

### Technical Implementation Notes
- **ar-drone Library Camera Commands**: Use client.config('video:video_channel', channelValue) method for camera switching (0 = front camera, 1 = bottom camera)
- **WebSocket Command Handling**: Extend existing SWITCH_CAMERA command processing in backend WebSocket server
- **Camera State Tracking**: Frontend should track current camera state for visual feedback (toggle between front/bottom)
- **Visual Design**: Clear camera switch icon/button with visual indication of current camera selection
- **Button Integration**: Position camera switch control appropriately within existing UI layout alongside flight controls
- **State Management**: Track current camera state in frontend component for proper visual feedback

### Integration with Existing Components
- **DroneClient Enhancement**: Extend proven DroneClient class with ar-drone camera switching methods
- **WebSocket Server**: Build on established WebSocket SWITCH_CAMERA command processing infrastructure
- **React Integration**: Follow established component and hook patterns from FlightControls and MovementControls
- **UI Layout**: Integrate CameraSwitchControl alongside existing FlightControls and MovementControls components

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/13-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Location**: Co-locate test files with source files using .test.ts/.tsx extension
- **Backend Framework**: Jest for testing DroneClient camera switching command methods
- **Frontend Framework**: Vitest for testing CameraSwitchControl component and useDroneSocket hook
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock all external dependencies (ar-drone library, WebSocket connections, button events)
- **Test Data**: Hardcode test data directly in test files (camera states, command types)
- **Coverage Focus**: Test camera switch command generation, button click handling, visual feedback, WebSocket communication
